**Hello world**, I am not a blogger.

Nor do I claim to be! I don't spit facts, I spit what I happen to be thinking at the time. The world is big and my place in it is tiny but I do my damndest to make a difference.

If you're reading this I'm building the site still and I don't know how the hell you even stumbled upon it. Good for you! I'm impressed by your gumption. Me? Well, I have been doing web development and software engineering and some management stuff at Livestock Nutrition Center the past couple of years.

I love web development but the whole reason I went to software bootcamp was to one day code my own games. That's what this site will mostly be about.I'll probably have some other sprinkling of web dev or mobile dev or whatever passing thoughts hit my thick skull. Here's to you for reading this at all :champagne emoji:

My current goals are to make two or three games using Unity to list in a portfolio and link from github and itch to this site. I have done some Udemy and Unity Learn courses and am getting a feel for things. My excitement is as deep as it is wide but I am still spending time trying to learn C# as well as I know Javascript. If my mentor taught me anything, it's that clean code practices cannot be undervalued.

Additionally I'm working on building a little React Native app in my spare time but that projects a secret and I'll let y'all know if and when I can share anything about it *wink*

Happy 2021 (as happy as it can be given the pretty bleak outlook of many things)
